Answer Of CocoTechoes Prv Ltd answer Of 13th question 

Question 13:

Web traffic analysis - We have an array of say 5 cities where we are tracking our everyday
web-site. You can put any 5 cities you like. In the future, we should be able to add more cities
to it. Under each city create about 100 visit entries. Each visit entry will be userId (Random
integer between 1 to 30), time of day (morning|noon|evening|night) picked randomly, and
timeSpentMinutes. We do not need the date of the visit as these entries are for one day. Once
the data is generated output the following
1. Time of day(morning|noon...) when the site has the most number of unique users
2. Which city uses the site most at which time of day e.g. Pune Morning 60 users
